# Welcome to WhysOnMyMind!

Hi there! Welcome to **WhysOnMyMind**, a place where I share all the fascinating things I've learned in my life. Here, you'll find a treasure trove of knowledge, musings, and discoveries. So, buckle up and let's embark on an adventure of learning and exploration!

## My Learning Journey

Throughout my life, I've dived deep into various topics and subjects, and I can't wait to share them with you. From programming languages to scientific theories, from artistic endeavors to philosophical ponderings, I've explored it all!

## What's in Store?

Here's a glimpse of the exciting content you can expect on WhysOnMyMind:

### SmartyPants - Elevate Your Typographic Game

Did you know that you can use ASCII punctuation characters to create "smart" typographic punctuation in HTML? It's true! For example, try using single backticks to display `'Isn't this fun?'`, or double quotes to show `"Isn't this fun?"`. And don't forget en-dashes and em-dashes: `-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`.

### Unraveling Mathematical Marvels with KaTeX

Are you a math enthusiast? I sure am! Let's dive into the world of mathematical expressions using KaTeX. For instance, the Gamma function $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)! \quad \forall n\in\mathbb N$ is intriguingly linked to the Euler integral:

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$

### Visualizing Ideas with UML Diagrams

Communicating complex ideas can be a breeze with UML diagrams. We'll use Mermaid to create awesome diagrams, like this sequence diagram:

```mermaid

Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
